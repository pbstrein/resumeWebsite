Peter Strein is a dude. He does stuff. He's cool. You should hire him.

In all seriousness, hello all, I'm Peter Strein. I was born and raised in Fort Collins, CO. The majority of my childhood was spent playing video games and being on the comptuer. According to a family story, when I was 18 months old, I learned how to type "WIN" to start our family computer before I could even talk. I have always enjoyed being on the computer and playing video games. But, one day, when I was in the 6th grade, my older brother told me, "Instead of playing video games, why don't you make them?" He gave me a book about programming, and I started doing it and I loved it. I programmed all through middle school and high school, making some video games through GameMaker and Unity. I also learned technologies like PhotoShop and Blender while in High School.

When I came to college I decided to study Computer Science and have not regretted that decision ever since. My favorite classes have been Computer Science classes, and whenever my program works as it should, I almost always do a double-fist in the air and shout "I am the Master Commander!" (name that quote) 

My main hobbies include music and playing video games. I play Trumpet, Piano, and sing. While at BYU, I activily participate in the BYU Men's Chorus. I have also participated in the Symphonic Band at BYU playing trumpet. 

I am also an active member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Mormons), participating activly in church services and activies. From May 2014 - May 2016, I served an LDS mission in Honduras. I learned a lot there about poverty, and truly what matters most in life. I am also now fluent in Spanish due to the church mission.
