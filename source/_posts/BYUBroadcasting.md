{% blockquote BYU BroadCasting's Mission %}
"See the good in the world."
{% endblockquote %}

I started working at BYU Broadcasting in September 2016. I hired into the Digital Media Team as a Computer Programmer for the Platform Group to develop [BYUTV3](/2017/05/02/BYUTV/), a new and updated version of their website. 

The BYU Broadcasting is located on the BYU Campus in Provo, Utah. They create, produce, and distrubute content for millions to see and view. Their mission is to "inspire people to see, do, and be the good in the world."
