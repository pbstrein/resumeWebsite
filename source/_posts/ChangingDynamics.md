This is a game I created in High School for an art class. As I am not the most artistic person (the best I can draw are stick figures, and even then they aren't great stick figures) I decided to make a video game instead that would focus on changing the game to make the game more beatiful that longer the player played.

The game is a platform maze game. The exit is hidden, and to find the exit to the level, one aspect of the game will change or "beautify." For example, in the first level, as you got closer to the exit, the background would change from a black screen to a pretty sky background. My goal was to create a game that would uplift the player through beatification, much like art as a painting or any other form would.

I created the game with the Unity Game Engine and C#. I did all the programming, level design, game design, and game logic outside what the Unity Game Engine provided. As far as the models and assets, those were all provided by friends or the internet.
