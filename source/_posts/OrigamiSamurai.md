Origami Samurai is a video that I tried making in High School with the Digital Animation Club. During my freshman year, I was walking down the hallway and saw an advertisement for making club making a video game. Being the video game/programming nerd that I am, I went to the club. I stayed part of that club all throughout highschool.  Although our group was small and very inexperienced, we did our very best to make a videogame. What we sought out to do was over our heads, but we enjoyed it and we learned a lot from the process.

The idea of Origami Samurai was to have make a game with an origami art style, focusing on the story of a child growing up. Our goal was to learn how to use 3D animation using Blender, making video games through Unity and C#, and in general creating art.

I came on as a progammer, using Unity and C# to make the game. I also learned how to use Blender to create models, textures, rigging, and animation. By my sophomore year, I was the student in charge of the Animation Club. I was responsiblefor trying to get new recruits, teach people how to 3D animate, and bringing together art people and computer people to make a game. As the lead, it my was duty to help motivate people to do their work. It was difficult as many people wanted to have fun than make a videogame. But did make a few full rendered videos and created two levels that could be played, one that showcaded our models, and another tutorial used to introduce a new player to the game. I was also in charge of making the game through Unity and C#.
