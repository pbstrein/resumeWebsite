CIRA stands for The Cooperate Institute for Reaseach in the Atmosphere. They are part of Colorado State Universtiy located in Fort Collins, CO. It is comprised of many "weather nerds" - meterologists, atmospheric scientists, etc. 

I was part of a technical team for CIRA. They were in charge of the website, managing data for the scientists, and most importantly, collecting and managing data from CloudSat, a satelite that CIRA has had going for over 10 years. I came on as a Web Developer for the website, but was quickly given programming assigments to do in Python. During my two months there, I wrote three programs - JobBuilder, GapAnalyzer, and CalipsoGapDetector.

Working at CIRA was quite fun, and I enjoyed the group I was in a lot. Every Monday and Wednesday at lunch we would play SheepsHead. Its basically the card game hearts, gone crazy. But it was really fun and I learned a lot by being at CIRA.
